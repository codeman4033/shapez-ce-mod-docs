# Getting Started

In this getting started guide, you will learn how to:

* Setup your development environment
* Code a mod for Shapez CE
* Package your mod for distribution
* Submit your mod for review
* Among other things

There are several ways of doing all of this.

* Manually
* With the `create-shapez-ce-mod` package (TODO)

> [!NOTE]
> The `create-shapez-ce-mod` doesn't yet exist.

We will go over both ways in this guide.
